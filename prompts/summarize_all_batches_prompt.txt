📥 Input  
You are given:  
- `user_request`: {user_request}  
- `summaries`: {summaries}  
- `batch_info`: {{

🧠 Guidelines  
Follow these principles carefully:  
1. **Read all summaries** and **reflect step-by-step** (Chain-of-Thought) before writing the final summary.  
2. The final output should be **coherent, concise, and directly address the `user_request`**.  
3. **Do not speculate or hallucinate.** Only use information present in the summaries.  
4. Output should be in the following **structured JSON** format:

```json
{{
  "reasoning": "Step-by-step explanation of how you derived the final summary from the batch summaries.",
  "summary": "Final concise summary that answers the user_request clearly and factually."
}}
```

📝 Example input:  
- `user_request`: "Summarize how agents respond to refund-related issues."  
- `summaries`: [  
    "Agents typically acknowledge the issue, express regret, and provide refund timelines.",  
    "Most responses include confirmation of refund initiation and estimated processing times."  
  ]  
- `batch_info`: {{
    "num_batches": 2,
    "rows_per_batch": 10,
     "total_num_of_rows": 20
}}
